# EXERCISE 1: What method you used to make your peer download and upload
#    files in parallel?  (~1-3 sentences)
We used fork to parallelize downloads and uploads.
We forked a child process for each download, stored the pid of the child process,
started the download, and waited on each child process.
Then we started listening for uploads, forked a new process for each upload,
storing the pid, and then iterated through the stored pids to clear the
finished uploads.

# EXERCISE 2A: What conditions did you find and fix that would have
#    triggered a buffer overrun bug?  (~1-3 sentences each)
We take input in two places, processing peer and get requests.
We should always validate external input for security reasons and to avoid
buffer overrun bugs.
The program alread used osp2p_snscanf to parse input so we added the
additional check of making sure the length of the string is less than
TASKBUFSIZ and FILENAMESIZ respectively.

# EXERCISE 2B: What other robustness problems did you fix?  (~1-3 sentences
#    each)
We fixed the issue of uploading files outside of our working directory by
using getcwd and realpath to make sure that the requested file is inside
the working directory.
We checked to limit the size of any downloaded file so that one file
would not consume all resources and that we would not download a single
file indefinitely. The size limit, 2^30 bytes, is arbitrary but large 
enough to accomodate most reasonable files. 

# EXERCISE 3: Describe the attacks you implemented for "evil mode".  Why
#    are they attacks?  (~3-10 sentences each)
We implemented an attack involving buffer overflow by replacing the GET request
with a string of 'A's greater than the size of the buffer. This is an attack 
because it changes memory inappropriately. Though a string of A's is intended
to crash the program, theoretically code could be inserted into the buffer overflow. 
We also implemented an attack where, instead of reading the file requested, we 
continually feed data from /dev/urandom. Not only is the corrent file data not being passed, 
/dev/urandom is not a constant file and causes a large amount of garbage data 
to be passed, overwhelming client resources.
